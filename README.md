# JHU-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project-1
This repo contains code and PNG files for graphs created from R for JHU's Exploratory Data Analysis course offered through Coursera

There are four R code files and four png files, each with a corresponding number of 1,2,3, or 4. 
The R code files contain code for reading the data, plotting the graph, and writing the graph to a png file.
The png files contain the result of the R code.
